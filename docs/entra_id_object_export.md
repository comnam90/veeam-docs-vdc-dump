# Entra ID Object Export

In this article

You can export backed-up Microsoft Entra ID objects (such as users, groups, roles and so on) to JSON files for further import or restore into Microsoft Entra ID or compatible systems. The exported data includes all object properties, relationships and a relevant schema. Veeam Data Cloud also exports sensitive data if it was backed up.

You can export only one object type at a time. If you want to export more object types, run a separate export session for each object type.

To export objects, do the following:

1. [Launch the Export Objects wizard](entra_id_object_export_launch.md).
2. [Select the restore points](entra_id_object_export_point.md).
3. [Finish working with the wizard](entra_id_object_export_summary.md).
4. [Download the exported files](entra_id_object_export_download.md).
