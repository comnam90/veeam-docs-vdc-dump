# Creating Restore Jobs


You can create drafts of restore jobs that you want Veeam Data Cloud to perform. After you create a draft, you can start the session right after you finish the restore job wizard or later as described in section [Starting and Stopping Restore Jobs](sf_restore_start_stop.md).
