# Restoring Records


With record restore, you can restore earlier versions of modified or corrupted Salesforce records and linked objects. Veeam Data Cloud allows you to fully restore the content of a record, with all fields that are marked as updatable and creatable in Salesforce. You can also restore attachments associated with this record and the related object hierarchy.

To restore Salesforce records, perform the following steps:

1. [Launch the Restore Records wizard](sf_restore_records_launch.md).
2. [Specify a name and description for the restore job](sf_restore_records_name.md).
3. [Select a target Salesforce tenant](sf_restore_records_orgnization.md).
4. [Choose the data that will be restored](sf_restore_records_data.md).
5. [Choose what attachments associated with the specified records will be restored](sf_restore_records_files.md).
6. [Enable restore of object hierarchy](sf_restore_records_hierarchy.md).
7. [Configure additional restore settings](sf_restore_records_options.md).
8. [Check permissions](sf_restore_records_verification.md).
9. [Finish working with the wizard](sf_restore_records_summary.md).
