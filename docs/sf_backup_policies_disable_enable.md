# Enabling and Disabling Backup Policies

In this article

By default, Veeam Data Cloud runs all created backup policies according to the specified schedules. However, you can temporarily disable a backup policy so that Veeam Data Cloud does not run the backup policy automatically. You will still be able to manually start or enable the disabled backup policy at any time you need.

To enable or disable a backup policy, do the following:

1. On the Salesforce page, click the name of the tenant you want to manage.
2. To view the policies created for this tenant, select Policies on the left.
3. On the Backup Policy tab, select Actions > Disable or Enable.
