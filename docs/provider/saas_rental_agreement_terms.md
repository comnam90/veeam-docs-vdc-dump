# Rental Agreements and Licensing Terms


The rental program offers two licensing term options, each with different contract term:

* No Commit Rental Agreements allow the use of Veeam Data Cloud for up to 75 days. Each month that you report rental usage to Veeam, the license files are extended by an additional 30 days. With regular reporting and payments, no-commit partners benefit from the full flexibility of Veeam licensing portability.
* Volume Rental Agreements (VRAs) provide longer licensing terms in exchange for a minimum monthly commitment. Pricing and benefits depend on the commitment level. For example, you can commit to 200 points of consumption per month across all your end customers. License keys remain active for the contract length and can be extended through a VRA extension or upgrade.

| Note |
| If you already have a VRA for Veeam products, you do not need a separate agreement for SaaS rental licensing. You can manage the license usage of Veeam software products and SaaS solutions under a single agreement. |

For any licensing option, the monthly usage consumption is based on the high watermark (HWM).
