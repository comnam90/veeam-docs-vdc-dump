# Managing Customer Users


Veeam Data Cloud allows you to create, edit and delete users in Veeam Data Cloud organizations of your customers. You can assign multiple roles to a user and configure a role scope. User roles define the operations that the user can perform, including backup, restore and user management.

You can assign a role with access to the entire Veeam Data Cloud organization or a specific workload, such as Microsoft Entra ID, Salesforce or Microsoft 365. Role scopes define which tenants the user can access.This can be helpful in larger organizations with multiple tenants where users are assigned to manage specific tenants.

User management of your customer organization is available only if the customer allowed you to manage their organization. For details, see the [Configuring Partner Access](https://helpcenter.veeam.com/docs/vdc/userguide/sp_partner_access.html) section of the Veeam Data Cloud User Guide.
