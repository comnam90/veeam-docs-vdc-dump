# Onboarding Customers


After you create a customer and assign a subscription in VCSP Pulse, you can onboard the subscribed customer and add their tenants to Veeam Data Cloud. Alternatively, you can invite your customers to add their tenants to Veeam Data Cloud and complete the onboarding process themselves. Veeam Data Cloud allows you to add multiple tenants to a workload using a single customer subscription.

Veeam Data Cloud will configure your access to the Veeam Data Cloud organization of the customer depending on the onboarding method you choose for the first tenant in the customer organization.

* If you choose provider-managed onboarding, Veeam Data Cloud allows you to manage Veeam Data Cloud users, work with backup policies and restores and configure tenant settings in the Veeam Data Cloud organization of your customer.
* If you choose customer-managed onboarding, Veeam Data Cloud prevents you from managing the Veeam Data Cloud organization of your customer.

The customer can change this setting. For details, see the [Configuring Partner Access](https://helpcenter.veeam.com/docs/vdc/userguide/sp_partner_access.html) section of the Veeam Data Cloud User Guide. Regardless of this setting, you can always add tenants and invite customers to add tenants to their organizations.
