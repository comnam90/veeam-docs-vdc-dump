# About Rental Licensing


The SaaS rental license is available exclusively to service providers that are members of the Veeam Cloud & Service Provider (VCSP) partner program. It allows VCSP partners to get access to the following benefits:

* Expanded capabilities of license usage rights to manage and protect third-party data with Veeam.
* Pay-As-You-Go (PAYG) pricing which offers consumption-based licensing to facilitate onboarding of customers and workloads.
* Automatic license update capabilities to maintain license distribution, purchase license extensions and increase license size at scale.
* Purpose-built products and partner portals designed to quickly onboard customers and facilitate monthly usage reporting.

For more information about SaaS licensing policy, see [Licensing Legal Agreements](https://www.veeam.com/legal/eula.html).
