# Veeam Data Cloud Vault Editions


Veeam Data Cloud Vault is available in several editions. They are available in the following variants:

* Foundation and Advanced

The main differences between the Foundation and Advanced editions are georedundancy options, data read and restore limits, and how precisely you can specify where to keep your data.

* Core and Non-Core

The difference between the Core and Non-Core editions is available regions for the vault location.

* Azure and AWS

The difference between the Azure and AWS editions is the public cloud environment where you can store your data: Microsoft Azure or AWS S3.

To use a particular edition of Veeam Data Cloud Vault, you must obtain a subscription. One subscription corresponds to one product edition. Thus, if you want to store data in different public cloud environments or in both core and non-core regions, you must obtain at least 2 subscriptions, for example, Advanced Non-Core - Azure and Advanced Core - AWS.
