# Managing Customer Subscriptions


To offer backup as a service using Veeam Data Cloud, the service provider must request subscriptions in VCSP Pulse. A subscription ensures that the appropriate licensing is available for a specific workload. Subscriptions are configured per customer and per workload. A customer with multiple tenants for the same workload uses a single subscription for all tenants.

Before you start managing subscriptions in VCSP Pulse, make sure that the account of the ProPartner employee you use to log in to VCSP Pulse meets the following requirements:

* The employee must have the Full Access role assigned. For more information on how to assign this role, see [Assigning Roles in ProPartner Portal](sp_customers_create_assign_roles.md).
* If you are a partner onboarded to site reporting, the employee must also be either the Primary License Administrator or the Site License Administrator.
