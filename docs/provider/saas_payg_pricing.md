# Pay-As-You-Go Pricing


Rental agreements for VCSP partners offer a rental pricing program:

1. Each product in the VCSP program has an assigned a Point Per Unit (PPU) value, delineated by workload and edition where applicable.
2. Veeam Aggregators offer standard price-per-point (PPP) rental agreements that follow pre-negotiated SaaS cost which corresponds to the level of commitment. You may upgrade at any time as your consumption grows. Each upgrade starts a new 12-month commitment.
3. After you sign the agreement and start using Veeam rental products, you will report your license consumption by the third day of each month through the VCSP Pulse platform and receive a bill from your Veeam Aggregator.

For more information about pay-as-you-go pricing, contact a VCSP Sales Representative or [find a Veeam Aggregator](https://www.veeam.com/distributors-aggregators.html).
