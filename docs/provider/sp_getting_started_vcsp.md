# Getting Started for Service Providers


Veeam Data Cloud supports integration with the Veeam Cloud & Service Provider (VCSP) program. Partners of the program (service providers) can use Veeam Data Cloud to offer backup as a service to their customers. To start using Veeam Data Cloud, the service provider must complete the following steps:

1. Create and register a Veeam Data Cloud customer. To do this, use the VCSP Pulse portal. If you want Veeam Data Cloud to back up your own data, you can also register your organization as a customer. For details, see [Creating Customers](sp_customers_create.md).
2. Request a subscription for a Veeam Data Cloud product. You can also create a new customer when requesting new subscriptions. For details, see [Requesting Subscriptions](sp_subscriptions_request.md).
3. Complete the customer onboarding. To do this, use the Veeam Data Cloud portal for service providers. For details, see [Onboarding Customers](sp_customers_onboard.md).

Once the service provider completes the customer onboarding, they can start performing data backup tasks and administrative tasks with customer accounts, as described in the subsequent sections of this guide. The service provider can also let customers manage their backup settings and work with their backup data using the Veeam Data Cloud customer portal. For more information, see the [Veeam Data Cloud User Guide](https://helpcenter.veeam.com/docs/vdc/userguide/welcome.html).

Information on Veeam Data Cloud usage is collected automatically and populated in the VCSP Pulse monthly usage report. For more information on how rental licensing works within Veeam Data Cloud, how to manage licenses using VCSP Pulse, and how to collect and report the license usage, see [Licensing](sp_licensing.md).
