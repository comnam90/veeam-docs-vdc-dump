# Licensing


To protect Salesforce tenants of your customers with Veeam Data Cloud for Salesforce you need to request a subscription-based license. For details, see [Requesting Subscriptions](sp_subscriptions_request.md).

The service is licensed per active Salesforce user, and only users with specific Salesforce user licenses count toward your purchased subscription. For more information, see [this Veeam article](https://www.veeam.com/legal/licensing-policy.html).

The Veeam license is not required for the following cases:

* Salesforce users of sandbox tenants.
* Salesforce users of Salesforce trial tenants.

Subscription Expiration

If your subscription expires and you do not renew it, Veeam Data Cloud will handle your tenants and backed-up data according to the Veeam Data Cloud service agreement. For more information, see [this Veeam article](https://www.veeam.com/legal/veeam-data-cloud-service-agreement.html).
