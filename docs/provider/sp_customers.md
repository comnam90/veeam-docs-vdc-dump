# Managing Customers


The Veeam Data Cloud and VCSP Pulse provide a workspace where you can manage your customers and their subscriptions. You can prepare accounts for customers and assign them subscriptions in VCSP Pulse and use Veeam Data Cloud to add their tenants to Veeam Data Cloud products and set tenant properties. Alternatively, you can invite customers to finish the onboarding process themselves.
