# Restoring Application Properties


You can restore one or multiple properties of an application or service principal. Before you restore the properties, you can compare the property values in the selected restore point with the values in production or in another restore point. To check the list of supported properties, see [Supported Entra ID Item Properties](entra_id_properties.md).

To restore Entra ID application properties, use the Compare and Restore Fields wizard.

1. [Launch the Compare and Restore Fields wizard](entra_id_restore_app_prop_launch.md).
2. [Select a restore point and properties](entra_id_restore_app_prop_point.md).
3. [Finish working with the wizard](entra_id_restore_app_prop_summary.md).
