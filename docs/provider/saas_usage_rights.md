# Expanded Usage Rights


Per the [Veeam End User License Agreement (EULA)](https://www.veeam.com/eula.html), licenses may not be used to process third party data. This restriction is lifted by leveraging SaaS rental licenses through the VCSP program allowing for the expanded usage rights to provide commercial hosting services and managed services powered by Veeam. However, to participate in this program, the provider must agree to report their license usage each month to Veeam and, therefore, must be able to access reporting for the customer environment. For more information about this requirement, see [Monthly Usage Reporting](saas_usage_reporting.md).
