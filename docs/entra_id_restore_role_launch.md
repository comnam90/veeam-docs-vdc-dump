| Consider the following:   * To find a role by its display name, you can use the search field.  * To show more role properties, click the menu icon and select the properties you want to show. * To filter roles based on whether they are built-in and enabled, click Filter and select the required values. * To export the list of roles for future references and imports, click Export and select the format in which you want to save the list. Veeam Data Cloud will export all backed-up roles and their properties that can be shown in the restore window. |
