# Enabling Application-Aware Processing


Veeam Data Cloud for AWS takes transactionally consistent EC2 snapshots while no write operations occur on volume disks — to do that, it quiesces applications on the processed EC2 instances and creates a consistent view of application data. To enable application-aware processing, set the Enable application-aware snapshots toggle to On.

Limitations and Requirements for Application-Aware Processing

If you plan to instruct Veeam Data Cloud for AWS to create transactionally consistent backups using application-aware processing, in addition to the [limitations and requirements for guest processing](aws_backup_create_ec2_guest_processing.md#limitations), consider the following:

* Application-aware processing is available only for EC2 instances running Microsoft Windows Server 2008 R2 or later.
* To create application-aware snapshots, the VSS Guest Agent uses the VSS Copy Backup technology that does not support truncation of transaction logs. For more information on VSS backup, see [Microsoft Docs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/vss/vss-backup-state).
* EC2 instances for which you plan to enable application-aware processing must meet the following prerequisites:

* The EC2 instances must have VSS components installed. To learn how to download and install VSS components, see [AWS Documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/WindowsGuide/application-consistent-snapshots-getting-started.html#run-command-vss-package).
* The EC2 instances must have access to the [Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/ec2-service.html) service.
* To allow Veeam Data Cloud for AWS to take VSS-enabled snapshots for the EC2 instances, the following permissions must be granted to the IAM roles attached to the instances:
