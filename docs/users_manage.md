# Users and Roles


Veeam Data Cloud allows you to create, edit and delete users in your Veeam Data Cloud organization. You can assign multiple roles to a user and configure a role scope. User roles define the operations that the user can perform, including backup, restore and user management.

You can assign a role with access to your entire Veeam Data Cloud organization or a specific workload, such as Microsoft Entra ID, Salesforce or Microsoft 365. Role scopes define which tenants the user can access. This can be helpful in larger organizations with multiple tenants where users are assigned to manage specific tenants.

User management is available only to users with the OrganizationAdmin role assigned.
