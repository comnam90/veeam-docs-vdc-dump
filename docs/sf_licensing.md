# Licensing


To protect your Salesforce tenants with Veeam Data Cloud for Salesforce you need to purchase a subscription-based license. Veeam offers annual subscriptions for Veeam Data Cloud for Salesforce, with multi-year options available. You can use one subscription to protect one or multiple Salesforce tenants. For more information on purchasing options, see [this Veeam article](https://www.veeam.com/products/veeam-data-cloud/purchasing-options.html#salesforce-tab).

The service is licensed per active Salesforce user, and only users with specific Salesforce user licenses count toward your purchased subscription. For more information, see [this Veeam article](https://www.veeam.com/legal/licensing-policy.html).

The Veeam license is not required for the following cases:

* Salesforce users of sandbox tenants.
* Salesforce users of Salesforce trial tenants.

License Overuse

Veeam Data Cloud uses a 10% license buffer to accommodate changes in your Salesforce user count. For example, a subscription with 100 licensed users allows you to protect up to 110 users without extra charges. To make sure you do not exceed the limit, align your Veeam Data Cloud licenses with your total Salesforce user licenses.

If your tenants use more than 120% of licensed users in your Veeam Data Cloud for Salesforce subscription, Veeam Data Cloud will display a warning that you have exceeded the limit. However, it will allow you to add a new tenant. If your tenants use more than 200% of licensed users in your Veeam Data Cloud for Salesforce subscription, Veeam Data Cloud will prevent you from adding a new Salesforce tenant.

Subscription Expiration

If your subscription expires and you do not renew it, Veeam Data Cloud will handle your tenants and backed-up data according to the Veeam Data Cloud service agreement. For more information, see [this Veeam article](https://www.veeam.com/legal/veeam-data-cloud-service-agreement.html).
