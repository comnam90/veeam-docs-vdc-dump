# Adding Storage Vaults


The first storage vault is created as part of onboarding a new Vault tenant. You can add new storage vaults at any time, for example, if you need to store data in another region.

Veeam Data Cloud Vault users can add storage vaults based on their Veeam Data Cloud Vault edition. To learn more, see [Veeam Data Cloud Vault Editions](vault_editions.md).

Based on their subscription, users have the following options:

* [Add a storage vault for an Azure Veeam Data Cloud Vault edition](vault_storage_vaults_add_azure.md)
* [Add a storage vault for an AWS Veeam Data Cloud Vault edition](vault_storage_vaults_add_aws.md)
