# Licensing

In this article

Licensing for Veeam Data Cloud for Microsoft Entra ID is based on the user accounts you back up. Each enabled Entra ID member user is counted towards your purchased license or free allowance. Groups, roles and other Microsoft Entra ID objects do not consume the license or allowance, but Veeam Data Cloud protects them too.

Licensing Plans

To protect your Entra ID data, you can choose one of the following licensing plans depending on the Veeam Data Cloud subscriptions that you want to use. The Entra ID Standalone plan allows you to protect your Entra ID data only. If you also want to protect your Microsoft 365 data, you can choose one of the bundle plans.

The bundles include a free allowance for your Entra ID tenant. You can protect up to three enabled Entra ID member users for every backed-up Microsoft 365 user. For example, if 10,000 Microsoft 365 licensed users are backed up in Veeam Data Cloud for Microsoft 365, you can protect up to 30,000 enabled Entra ID member users in Veeam Data Cloud for Microsoft Entra ID. Veeam Data Cloud also protects disabled and guest users, but they do not consume your license or allowance. Note that you can use the allowance only when all Microsoft 365 users in your Microsoft 365 tenant are backed up. For details, see [Veeam Data Cloud Fair Use Policy](https://www.veeam.com/legal/veeam-data-cloud-fair-use.html).

License Expiration

If your subscription expires and you do not renew it, Veeam Data Cloud will suspend your backup policy for 30 days. During this period, your existing Entra ID backups are still available, and you can use Veeam Data Cloud to restore your Entra ID data. After 30 days, Veeam Data Cloud will permanently delete your Entra ID tenant and all related data.
