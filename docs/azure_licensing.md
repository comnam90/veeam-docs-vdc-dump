# Licensing

In this article

Veeam Data Cloud for Microsoft Azure is licensed on a Back-End Terabyte (BETB) basis. This means that your subscription costs depend on the actual size of the backup data in the storage repository after compression.

| Note |
| Veeam Data Cloud for Microsoft Azure compresses all backed-up data when saving to backup repositories. The compression rate depends on the type and structure of the source data, and usually varies from 50% to 60%. The compressed data typically uses 50% less storage space than the source data. |

You can monitor the storage space consumed by the Veeam Data Cloud backups on the Azure Management page. For more information, see [Viewing Microsoft Azure Tenants](azure_tenant_view.md).
