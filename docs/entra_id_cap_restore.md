# Entra ID Conditional Access Policies Restore

In this article

If you want to restore Microsoft Entra ID Conditional Access policy data, you can do either of the following:

* [Restore entire Conditional Access policies from a backup or Entra ID recycle bin](entra_id_restore_cap.md). You can restore one or multiple objects.
* [Restore specific Conditional Access policy properties](entra_id_restore_cap_prop.md). You can restore one or multiple properties.

| Note |
| The Conditional Access policies restore is available only if you enable the backup of Conditional Access policies first and Veeam Data Cloud completes an Entra ID backup with this option enabled. For details, see [Settings](entra_id_settings.md#enabligcap). |
