# Activating Subscription in Microsoft Azure Marketplace


If you purchased a subscription to Veeam Data Cloud for Microsoft 365 through the Microsoft Azure Marketplace and did not complete the onboarding steps, you must activate your subscription to perform backups. To do this, perform the following steps:

1. Log in to the [Microsoft Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/) using an account with global administrator privileges.
2. In the search bar at the top center of the screen, search for SaaS and select the SaaS option from the search results.
3. The portal displays a list of SaaS application subscriptions within your Azure account.
4. On the Overview page, select the subscription you created when you processed the original offer.
5. When the application loads, review and confirm your subscription and click the Open SaaS Account on publisher's site link.
6. The Veeam Data Cloud fulfillment page will open. Click Click Here to Activate to complete the activation of your subscription.

After you perform these steps, the Veeam Data Cloud environment opens and you can configure your backups. To learn more, see [Managing Microsoft 365 Tenants](m365_tenant.md).
