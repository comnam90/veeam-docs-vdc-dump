# Salesforce Protection

In this article

Veeam Data Cloud for Salesforce is a backup as a service solution developed for data and metadata protection of the Salesforce SaaS platform. With Veeam Data Cloud for Salesforce, you can perform the following operations:

* Back up Salesforce files, data and metadata.
* Encrypt data on the client side with original (built-in) or AWS KMS keys.
* Assign different backup schedules for different Salesforce objects to meet the desired RPOs.
* Create high-frequency backups of specific objects.
* Restore files, data and metadata, including object hierarchies and custom fields.
* Restore files, fields, records and objects of entire Salesforce tenants.
* Restore data and metadata (including Reports, Profiles, Permission sets, Flows and so on).
* Restore object hierarchy to an unlimited level of depth.
* Restore child and parent relationships.
* Archive data that is no longer needed but must be retained for future reference or regulatory compliance reasons.

* Configure granular retention settings at the object level.
* Compare versions of production Salesforce records with versions of backed-up records stored in backups.
* Compare versions of production Salesforce metadata with versions of backed-up metadata stored in backups to see line-by-line differences.
* Create real-time notifications for backup, recovery and Salesforce connection issues, as well as for any changes in protected data.
