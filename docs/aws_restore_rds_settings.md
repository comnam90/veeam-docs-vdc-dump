# Step 6. Configure RDS Resource Settings


[This step applies only if you have selected the Restore to new location, or with different settings option at the Restore Mode step of the wizard]

At the Settings step of the wizard, specify settings for the restored RDS resources. To do that, follow the instructions provided in sections [Configuring Settings for DB Instances](aws_restore_rds_instance_settings.md) and [Configuring Settings for Aurora DB Clusters](aws_restore_rds_cluster_settings.md).

| Tip |
| The Settings step also contains some preconfigured settings retrieved from the source RDS resources. If you want to specify advanced configuration settings for a restored DB instance or Aurora DB cluster, select the necessary resource and click Advanced Options. For more information on all available settings that can be specified for RDS resources, see the [Amazon RDS User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_CreateDBInstance.html#USER_CreateDBInstance.Settings) and [Amazon Aurora User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/Aurora.CreateInstance.html#Aurora.CreateInstance.Settings). |
