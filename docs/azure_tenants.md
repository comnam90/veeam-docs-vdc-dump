# Working with Microsoft Azure Tenants


In Veeam Data Cloud for Microsoft Azure, a workload tenant is a set of Azure resources grouped under an Azure tenant account and Azure subscription. You can add multiple Azure subscriptions to a workload tenant scope, but every subscription can be added to only one workload tenant. Workload tenants provide a mechanism for organizing your Azure resources for backup purposes and controlling access to these resources.

You can perform the following operations with workload tenants:

* [Add new tenants](azure_tenant_add.md)
* [View the list of tenants and their provisioning status](azure_tenant_view.md)
* [Access management tools for provisioned tenants](azure_tenant_dashboard.md)
