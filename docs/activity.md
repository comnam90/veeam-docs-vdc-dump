# Organization Activity

In this article

The Activity view enables you to monitor and analyze protection activity across all workloads in your Veeam Data Cloud organization. It consolidates backup sessions and audit log events from your entire environment into a single, filterable interface. You can use this view to quickly identify issues, verify backup session statuses, and ensure that all objects are properly protected.

This Activity view is available to users with one of the following roles or role sets assigned:

* OrganizationAdmin.
* OrganizationViewer and an administrator role for one or multiple workloads. For example, OrganizationViewer, EntraID:Administrator and M365:Administrator.
