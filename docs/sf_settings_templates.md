# Managing Data Masking Templates


Veeam Data Cloud allows you to mask sensitive information (such as user names, passwords, credit card numbers and so on) when restoring data to a sandbox. To do that, you can use a default data masking template as is or customize it for your specific needs.

When Veeam Data Cloud applies a template while performing a restore operation, the restored data is replaced with randomly generated values so that this information can be shared without compromising confidentiality.
