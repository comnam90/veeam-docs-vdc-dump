# Scheduling Reports


You can schedule reports in Veeam Data Cloud for Microsoft 365. When you schedule a report, you specify the frequency and email recipients. Once a scheduled report runs, the recipients receive an email from Veeam Data Cloud for Microsoft 365 with a link to download the report. The report is valid for 7 days.

To schedule a report, use the Schedule Report wizard.

1. [Launch the Schedule Report wizard](m365_reports_schedule_launch.md).
2. [Specify report details](m365_reports_schedule_details.md).
3. [Select the schedule frequency](m365_reports_schedule_frequency.md).
4. [Specify the recipients of the scheduled report](m365_reports_schedule_recipients.md).
5. [Finish working with the wizard](m365_reports_schedule_finish.md).
