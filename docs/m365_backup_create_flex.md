# Creating Flex Backup Policies

In this article

You can create new backup policies in Veeam Data Cloud for Microsoft 365.

Before you start creating backup policies, check [Considerations and Limitations](m365_considerations_limitations.md#backup).

To create new backup policies, use the New Backup Policy wizard:

1. [Launch the New Backup Policy wizard](m365_backup_create_flex_launch.md).
2. [Configure policy information](m365_backup_create_flex_config_policy.md).
3. [Configure backup data](m365_backup_create_flex_config_data.md).
4. [Finish working with the wizard](m365_backup_create_flex_finish.md).

| TIP |
| During your initial full backup, Microsoft may be throttling your traffic due to the high load of Microsoft Exchange data. To mitigate this, you can temporarily disable Microsoft Exchange throttling in the Microsoft 365 admin center. For detailed instructions on how to disable Microsoft throttling, see [this Veeam KB article](https://www.veeam.com/kb4198). |
