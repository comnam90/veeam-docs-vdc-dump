# Restoring User Properties

In this article

You can restore one or multiple user properties. Before you restore the properties, you can compare the property values in the selected restore point with the values in production or in another restore point. To check the list of supported properties, see [Supported Entra ID Item Properties](entra_id_properties.md).

To restore Entra ID user properties, use the Compare and Restore Fields wizard.

1. [Launch the Compare and Restore Fields wizard](entra_id_restore_prop_launch.md).
2. [Select a restore point and properties to restore](entra_id_restore_prop_point.md).
3. [Finish working with the wizard](entra_id_restore_prop_summary.md).
