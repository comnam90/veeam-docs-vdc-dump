# Managing Microsoft 365 Tenants


To start protecting your Microsoft 365 data, you must add a Microsoft 365 workload tenant to Veeam Data Cloud. The onboarding process takes only a few minutes to complete. Additionally, if required, you can connect with a member of our Customer Success team who will guide you through the entire process.
